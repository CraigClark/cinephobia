      <!-- You can title whatever you want, I prefer not starting with the episode number because in a podcast app,
       screen size is limited so I only see the episode number, the rest is cut off. I hate that.
        I have no clue what Episode 47 is -->

      <!-- Add the episode-specific image here 
      I couldn't get this to work, you might need to update the ID3 tags
      with artwork that meets apple criteria https://podcasters.apple.com/support/896-artwork-requirements
      AND add the image here. I'd try both.
      When this fails, it shows the image for the podcast.
